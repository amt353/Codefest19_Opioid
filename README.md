Predicting Opioid epidemic progression from EMS radio audio

## Rationale and Goal
Philadelphia is one of many locations in the US that is affected by economic inequity.  By July 2018, nearly 3 million low-income Pensylvania residents were enrolled in Medicaid/ CHIP [1].  Community poverty has been shown to be a risk factor of drug addiction to which the opioid epidemic is linked [2].  The aim of this project is to model the opioid epidemic progression and predict its progression through analsys of EMS radio audio, such as on police channels, to identify incidents of opioid-related calls along with location and time.  Future works include scraping additional attributes from other EMS data that would ideally improve the model's prediction.
